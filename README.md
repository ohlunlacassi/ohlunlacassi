## About Me
Hey there! Welcome to this incredible journey of transformation! As a Bangkok native living in Germany, I've experienced a colorful life, both literally as a makeup artist and figuratively as I delved into the world of web development.

Isn't it fascinating how my love for creating beauty through colors and brushes can beautifully combine with the world of web development? My transition from a makeup artist to a web developer is a shining example of how diverse passions can lead to exciting new adventures. Both makeup artistry and web development share a common thread of creativity. Whether I'm crafting a stunning makeup look or designing a visually appealing website, creativity plays a significant role in both professions.

With my background in German Studies and Economics, I dived into coding and design, showing my determination to explore and embrace the digital world fully. The way I blend my creative flair with technical skills is truly inspiring and promises to craft captivating and user-friendly web experiences.

I'm thrilled to share that I'm still learning web development and within the next three months, I'll officially be a Web Developer! The enthusiasm I have for this field will undoubtedly lead to incredible achievements and innovative creations.

So, let's embark on this exciting ride together, where art and technology collide to create the most amazing web experiences. Let's connect with fellow creatives and developers, and together, let's explore the ever-changing digital landscape with open minds and endless possibilities! I believe the best is yet to come!
