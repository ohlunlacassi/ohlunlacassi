## My Stories 
Hey there! Welcome to this incredible journey of transformation! As a Bangkok native living in Germany, I've experienced a colorful life, both literally as a makeup artist and figuratively as I delved into the world of web development.

My transition from a makeup artist to a web developer is a shining example of how diverse passions can lead to exciting new adventures. Both makeup artistry and web development share a common thread of creativity. Whether I'm crafting a stunning makeup look or designing a visually appealing website, creativity plays a significant role in both professions.

With my background in German Studies and Economics, I dived into coding and design, showing my determination to explore and embrace the digital world fully. The way I blend my creative flair with technical skills is truly inspiring and promises to craft captivating and user-friendly web experiences.
